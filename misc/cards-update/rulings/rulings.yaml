# ## Design notes
#
# The core principle of this project is to provide a curated list of rulings
# **in a format that can withstand the passing of time**.
#
# We have lost countless ressources to the passing decades because they were hosted in unmaintained databases
# or in other impracticle formats.
# With hindsight, the most resilient formats are the simplest time-tested text-based standards.
# For example, the cards database, maintained in CSV format, or the TWD archive in plain HTML.
#
# Here, we have opted for YAML, because it offers a more flexible structure than CSV (multiple rulings per card),
# and is more readable than JSON, if anyone has to pick the project up without context in the future.
#
# ### Design principle
#
# **The rulings reference is a single self-sufficient YAML file. It is usable with a text editor, without processing.**
#
# ### Design details
#
# 1. The rulings can contain disciplines and card types symbols in brackets (eg. `[pot]`), see the list below
# 2. The rulings can contain card names in braces (eg. `{Abbot}`)
# 3. Each ruling ends with one or more rulings reference IDs in brackets.
#    References URLs are listed in the [references.yaml](rulings/references.yaml) file
# 4. Rulings are attached to a card, the format of the key is `<card_id>|<card_name>`, using the VEKN CSV cards IDs,
#    or to group of cards, using the `<id>|<name>` format, with an ID beginning with `G`. Cards groups are listed in
#    the [groups.yaml](rulings/groups.yaml) file.
#
# #### List of symbols
#
# - Inferior disciplines: abo, ani, aus, cel, chi, dai, dem, dom, for, mal, mel, myt, nec, obe, obf, obl, obt, pot, pre,
#   pro, qui, san, ser, spi, str, tem, thn, tha, val, vic, vis
# - Superior disciplines: ABO, ANI, AUS, CEL, CHI, DAI, DEM, DOM, FOR, MAL, MEL, MYT, NEC, OBE, OBF, OBL, OBT, POT, PRE,
#   PRO, QUI, SAN, SER, SPI, STR, TEM, THN, THA, VAL, VIC, VIS
# - Virtues: vin, def, jus, inn, mar, ven, red
# - Card types: ACTION, POLITICAL, ALLY, RETAINER, EQUIPMENT, MODIFIER, REACTION, COMBAT, REFLEX, POWER
# - Other: FLIGHT, MERGED, CONVICTION
#
#  Note the "Vision" virtue uses the `[vsn]` trigram, to avoid confusion with the "Visceratika" discipline `[vis]`.
#  Some versions of the VEKN CSV do use `[vis]` for both indistinctively.
#
# ### Discarded options
#
# We discarded some options after careful consideration:
#
# 1. We could have used some **fields for the rulings** (separating symbol prefix, text, and references).
#    Although a proper API _should_ present the rulings structure this way, the reference file must be kept as simple
#    and readable as possible. The current structure _stays usable_ with very little post-treatment, which is better.
#    Producing an alternative, more structured version, of the rulings, could be done by automated parsing.
#
# 2. We could have used **cards IDs only** and not bother with the cards name, but this would make this reference file
#    unusable out of the box without the proper tooling. Such as it is, the file can be opened and a card searched for
#    by name with just a text editor.
#
# 3. The **cards names** are the ones used in the VEKN CSV reference file. We could have opted for other alternatives,
#    but we believe consistency with the existing reference is the stronger argument.
#    Note different versions of the same vampires share the same name with different IDs (advanced, higher group).
100001|.44 Magnum:
  - Provides only one maneuver each combat, even if the bearer changes. [LSJ 19980302-2]
100002|419 Operation:
  - You can burn the edge to burn the card if it has no counter. [ANK 20221011-3]
100003|Aaron's Feeding Razor:
  - The effect is not optional. [RTR 19980707] [LSJ 19980722]
100004|Abactor:
  - '"Successful resolution" means the action must not be blocked and the vampire must have gained blood. If the vampire cannot
    gain blood (eg., {Vampiric Disease}, {Ex Nihilo}), the blood hunt is not called even if the action is not blocked. [LSJ
    20090411]'
  - This is not a diablerie. Neither {Rebirth} nor {Carlton Van Wyk}'s ability can be used. [LSJ 20090724] [ANK 20180129-1]
  - 'The Blood Hunt referendum is still a Blood Hunt: {Lay Low} can be used, {Trophy: Diablerie} would prevent the referendum.
    [LSJ 20091026] [LSJ 20100112]'
  - The Blood Hunt referendum is part of the action resolution. Cards that are played "after a successful action" or "after
    resolution" must be played after the referendum. {Heidelberg Castle, Germany} cannot be used before the referendum. [LSJ
    20100112] [PIB 20121028]
100005|Abandoning the Flesh:
  - Cannot be played when burned as a result of a Blood Hunt referendum. [LSJ 20070417]
  - Will not trigger the {Soul Gem of Etrius} since the vampire is removed from the game instead of being burned. [LSJ 20021010]
100006|Abbot:
  - The +1 intercept applies to actions directed at cards controlled by the controller. It does not apply to actions directed
    at other Methuselahs. [LSJ 20061222]
100007|Abjure:
  - Can be used by an incapacitated Imbued. [LSJ 20081016]
100008|Ablative Skin:
  - Cannot be used to prevent damage that cannot be prevented by cards that require Fortitude. [LSJ 19990216]
100009|Abombwe:
  - The requirements are ignored if the card is not played in the normal fashion (eg. diablerie or {Bima}). [LSJ 20051116-2]
100010|Abomination:
  - Can be played by burning a werewolf that has been recruited the same turn. [RTR 20180303]
100011|Absimiliard's Army:
  - Putting the top card of your library in play as a ghoul does not count as playing the card. [LSJ 20040531]
  - The card used to represent the ally is face up, but the name on that card is ignored if something goes looking for a card
    by name. They do not contest. [LSJ 20040623] [LSJ 20071003]
  - A burned ghoul is removed from the game but is still burned first, triggering cards such as {Tension in the Ranks}. [LSJ
    20090920]
100013|Absorb the Mind:
  - Can be played against a vampire with no blood. [RTR 20010711]

    on a vampire that already has superior) [LSJ 20011205-2]'
100014|Abyssal Hunter:
  - Burns if ranged aggravated damage is inflicted on it at close range. [PIB 20110818]
  - If he burns an ally with his action, this counts as a directed action burning an ally (eg. for Trophies). [ANK 20220507]
100018|Aching Beauty:
  - The pool loss occurs if the block would be successful, even if the action is ended (eg. {Change of Target} or {Obedience})
    or made unblockable ({Horrific Countenance}) at this point. [RTR 19991206] [LSJ 20091125]
  - Burn pool effects are cumulative. [LSJ 19980225]
100023|Admonitions, The:
  - Cannot be used when a card is played, to draw a card that would cancel it "as it is played". [RTR 20040501]
  - If you are the only Methuselah to control a Sabbat vampire, you keep control of The Admonitions each turn. [LSJ 20031121]
100024|Agate Talisman:
  - Can be equipped by a vampire with capacity less than 4, although they cannot lock it to get a vote. [LSJ 20030607]
100025|Agent of Power:
  - Is unique and provides a discipline even when it was not played in the normal fashion (eg. diablerie, {Deviki Prasanta},
    {Bima}). [LSJ 20071001-1] [LSJ 20100422]
  - If used as a placeholder to represent something else, its text does not apply (including the "Unique" part). A {Shock
    Troops} vampire would simply be a non-unique 1-cap Sabbat with no clan and no discipline. [LSJ 20071001-1]
  - If you play Agent of Power on a vampire and that vampire plays a {Dual Form} at superior [PRO], the Dual Form gains the
    Discipline provided by the Agent of Power and keeps it once the Agent of Power burns. [LSJ 20071005-1]
100027|Ahriman's Demesne:

100038|Alastor:
  - If the weapon retrieved costs blood, that cost is paid by the vampire chosen by the terms. [LSJ 20040518]
  - Requirements do not apply. If a discipline is required (eg. {Inscription}) and the Alastor vampire does not have it, the
    inferior version is used. [ANK 20200901] [LSJ 20040518-2]
  - Finding equipment is optional. When no equipment is found, alastor is still attached. [LSJ 20050331-2]
100040|Alpha Glint:
  - Cards that are played at the end of round/combat can still be played (eg. {Taste of Vitae}, {Disarm}). [RTR 20001020]
    [LSJ 20001024]
100043|Amaranth:
  - If both minions want to play a card "when a vampire should go into torpor", the acting minion goes first. If played first,
    {Undead Persistence} would prevent the opponent to play {Amaranth} and vice-versa. [RTR 20010710]
100048|Amulet of Temporal Perception:
  - A second copy allows a second use in the same turn. [ANK 20230316]
100050|Anachronism:

  - Can use {Pack Alpha} to put a retainer requiring [ani] in play. [LSJ 20060417]
100052|Anarch Free Press, The:
  - A hunt is not successful if no blood is gained, even if the hunt action is still successful. [LSJ 20050720-2]
  - Using it for the hunt bonus does not make the hunt an action "requiring an Anarch". [ANK 20220317]
100055|Anarch Revolt:
  - The cost is cumulative if they are multiple copies in play. [LSJ 19980225]
  - If a Methuselah controls no ready Anarch by the end of the unlock phase, they must burn 1 pool, even if they had a ready
    Anarch at some point during the unlock phase. [LSJ 20080106]
100058|Anarch Troublemaker:
  - Can lock a vampire that is already locked. [PIB 20121031]
100060|Anathema:
  - Burns the target vampire when the target is reduced to zero blood in combat, regardless of the source of the loss. [RTR
    19980623]
  - 'Will not burn a vampire for entering a combat with zero blood: there must be an actual blood loss. [RTR 19980623]'
  - Diablerie does not trigger Anathema. [LSJ 20021122-2] [ANK 20211112]
  - Does not trigger if the vampire is burned by aggravated damage during damage resolution. [LSJ 20021120]
  - Damage done by combat effects after combat ends do not trigger Anathema. [LSJ 19980225]
  - Multiple Anathemas don't multiply the pool gain. Once one Anathema resolves it burns the vampire and the others are burned
    before they get to resolve. [LSJ 20021117]
  - It is controlled by the controller of the minion it's on - it is not removed when another Methuselah is ousted. [PIB 20121028]

  - The effect is not optional. [RTR 19980707] [LSJ 19980722]

    even if the total was positive. [ANK 20180813]
100066|Anesthetic Touch:
  - Does not end combat as a strike; it ends combat after strike resolution. It is still just a hand strike. [LSJ 20011210-1]
  - A dodge won't prevent combat from ending after strike resolution. [LSJ 20011210-2]
  - Does not end combat until after strike resolution, so the damage can be prevented or healed as normal. [LSJ 20011210-3]
100067|Angel of Berlin:
  - May be played after a block is successful before combat begins. [LSJ 20060410]

    the action more than once (once per copy). [RTR 20030519]'
  - Burn blood effects are cumulative. [LSJ 19980225]
  - A vampire with no blood can still block, they burn what they can. [LSJ 19970707]
100085|Archon Investigation:
  - Must be played before action resolution, before any modifier or reaction played "as the action would be successful" are
    played (eg. cannot be played after a {Spying Mission} on the vampire triggers). [LSJ 19980105]

  - If the initial referendum does not pass, then the card is not put into play and the vampire playing it is not sent to
    torpor. [LSJ 20040730]
  - Goes to the ash heap when played, if it has been removed when the referendum passes, it has no effect. [ANK 20220805]
100117|Autonomic Mastery:
  - "[DOM] Is a hand strike, and its resolution is simultaneous with the opponent's strike, unlike a normal combat ends strike.\
    \ The opponent's strike do damage. [LSJ 20071112]"

    earlier rulings. [ANK 20210627]

    an effect can be used to continue the action as if unblocked (eg. {Crypt's Sons}, {Momentary Delay}). [LSJ 20090322] [ANK
    20181003] [LSJ 20010803-2]

    [RTR 19941109]
  - 'Is cumulative: a player can be damaged by multiple Betrayers each turn. A Methuselah targeted by more than one Betrayer
    would have to pay 1 pool for each Betrayer in order to burn them, even if the same vampire is the betrayer in each case.
    [RTR 19941109]'
  - If the vampire chosen for Betrayer is burned, so is Betrayer. If the vampire chosen for Betrayer becomes contested, Betrayer

    vampire that is the target of the betrayer, that player takes the pool loss. [RTR 19941109]
  - You select an uncontrolled vampire when you play the card. If you have a choice (more than one of your uncontrolled vampires
    is controlled by the other Methuselah), you still have to choose just one of them to be the Betrayer. [LSJ 19990419]

  - If the vampire has an ability to play Discipline-requiring cards "as if" he has that Discipline ({Ian Forestal}, for example),

  - If the action continues "as if unblocked", all action modifiers and reaction cards are still in effect, even those pertaining
    to a successful block. [RTR 19941109] [ANK 20190116]
  - If the action continues "as if unblocked", any Methuselahs that have declined to block before do not get another opportunity
    to block. [ANK 20190116]
  - For actions resulting from an action card, "continue as if unblocked" moves the action card from the ash heap (where it
    went when the action was blocked) to limbo (where it should be if the action is not blocked). If the action card is not
    in the ash heap, then the action cannot be continued. [LSJ 20070808-1]

    only be used after all triggered effects have been handled. [ANK 20220116] [ANK 20211207] [ANK 20210627]

  - The passive ability applies even if the vampire is in torpor. [LSJ 20011022]
G00108|Can steal minion during an action:
  - If used to steal a vampire in combat, combat ends. Any damage yet to resolve still resolves before the change of control.
    [LSJ 20020618]
  - If used to steal a minion attempting to block, the block attempt fails. [LSJ 20080326]
  - If used to steal a minion during an action, Methuselahs who declined to block are still declining to block. The new controller,
    if he is eligible and has not declined to block yet, can block with the stolen minion even if the previous controller
    has declined to block. [PIB 20150501]
  - If used to steal a minion targeted by an action, the action continues with the same target. Methuselahs who declined to
    block do not get another opportunity. If the target is not legal anymore (eg. [DOM] {Slaughtering the Herd}), the action
    fizzles (ends successfully with no effect). [LSJ 20020725]
  - Can be used to take control of the target at any point during the appropriate minion phase. It does not have to be done
    before non-mandatory actions. [LSJ 20001201]

  - If an {Agent of Power} is choosen its card text is not appled. The created vampire has no dsiciplines, is still non-unique

G00114|Effect during press step:

G00121|Steal blood as a Hunt action:
  - This special hunt cannot steal more blood than the target has. It can target a vampire with no blood. If no blood is stolen,
    the hunt is unsuccessful, even if the action stays successful. [LSJ 20050720-2] [RTR 20010711] [LSJ 20100915]
  - The blood stolen by this special hunt goes to the blood bank if it cannot be gained by the vampire. [LSJ 20010809-1]
  - This special hunt must be directed at a vampire, even if none has any blood. It cannot be performed if there are no other
    vampires. [LSJ 19970224]

    is not blood gained from the hunt) [RTR 20180511] [RTR 20030519]
G00122|Targets card in Ash Heap:
  - Is an undirected action, even when targeting another Methuselah's ash heap. [LSJ 20010627] [ANK 20180202]
  - Cannot be played if no target is available in any Methuselah's ash heap. [ANK 20200420-3]
G00123|Unlocks and attempts to block:

    the resulting combat if the block is successful. [LSJ 20090514]
G00124|Forces Block attempt:
  - Can be used by a vampire who is already attempting to block. [ANK 20181122-2]

    afterwards. Skip the Determine Range step for that round. [RTR 19970630] [ANK 20180720]
  - If another effect was already setting that round's range (e.g. {Neutral Guard}), that effect has priority. [PIB 20120214]
G00128|Equip or employ another card from hand:
  - The equipment or retainer must be announced by name, and in hand, when the card or effect is declared (before the card,
    if any, is replaced), but need not to be shown until the effect resolves. [LSJ 20100130] [ANK 20180925-2] [LSJ 19991207]
G00129|End of round effects that care about the range:
  - If the round ends before range is determined (e.g. {Alpha Glint}) Range is assumed to be at default (usually close, unless
    e.g. [dai]{Fear of the Void Below} was played), unless range was set by another effect (e.g. {Sniper Rifle}, [obe]{Neutral
    Guard}) [LSJ 20100709]
G00130|Lock to reduce cost:
  - Can be locked to reduce the cost at any point before resolution, from when the action is announced to just before the
    cost is paid. If it is used when announcing an action, and the action is cancelled as played (e.g. {Direct Intervention}),
    it is not locked. [ANK 20230620] [ANK 20170605] [LSJ 20090705]
