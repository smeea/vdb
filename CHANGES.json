      "Updated TWD search results to show capacity/clan for crypt and discipline/clan for library cards",
      "Added Preconstructed decks to Deck page to choose from",
      "Inventory mode for not-your-decks opened in Deck page (i.e. for TWD / shared by URL / Preconstructed): Highlights in red cards you don't have enough in Inventory; Highlights in yellow cards you have in total, but it will require to take it from one of 'fixed' decks; No highlight if you have it available",
      "Button to show missing in inventory cards for the deck in Deck page. It respects deck/card inventory status (Flexible or Fixed) and for Virtual (@) decks and any not-yours (twd / precon / shared by url) it calculate as it's Flexible (i.e. allowing to re-use cards from other Flexible decks but NOT from Fixed)",

      "Card quantity manual enter (click on card quantity) in addition to [+] and [-] buttons",
      "Inventory page option to choose what to show: All (cards you have + cards you need) Only owned cards Only cards you have problem with (first column is still quantity you have, not 'required')",
      "Additional 'Copy Deck-In-URL' button which 'encode' the deck to url. Why? Because standard Copy URL works as a 'pointer' to the deck in the author's deck archive it follows the changes (and deletion!) and even though it's OK most of the time (and maybe even desired), you may want to 'freeze' it to be sure the one following the link will ALWAYS see the deck in the state it was during URL creation. Technical details: this link contain all VDB need to render the deck (in the format ...?name=NAME&author=AUTHOR&description=DESCRIPTION#ID=QUANTITY;ID2=... where ID is card ID from official VEKN card list). So this 'deck-in-urls' does not exist (and does not require to ever be created) on the VDB server and may be easily generated by anyone (e.g. by third-party software as quick way to show the deck using VDB rendering) as well as decoded even when VDB will stop to work it will be easy to restore the deck from the url",
      "Crypt searches shows avg. capacity for each group in Total line",
      "Card text updated to VEKN changes dated 21-01-2021",
      "Added Maleficia, Striga and Flight to discipline filter in Library search Crypt/Library search page is more centered now for unlogged users; Fixed bug with non-ASCII letters for card search and export to Lackey",
