    "Add Sect indicator to crypt cards line, and Sect/Title to crypt card popup",
    "Add Brujah and Lasombra legacy images",
    "Add Garou Rim event in Joensuu, Finland (https://vdb.im/tournament_analyze/11707)",
    "Add Conviction cost to card line in results (deck, search). And no, Conviction cost filter will not come to Library (won't waste limited screen space for this marginal feature).",
    "A lot of small other fixes and improvements and a lot of code changes. This means new bugs in what used to work: please report and I'll fix it ASAP. This is unpleasant, but I need to overhaul the code from time to time, otherwise it becomes hard to maintain old (bad) code even if it 'just works'"
