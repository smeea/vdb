                We encourage people to mostly leave the deck unchanged after publishing. For

                cross-references between sister decks and/or give any explanation you want)

              <li>
                Author can remove the deck from PDA anytime, but each re-add creates new copy of the

                VDB save changes automatically, you don&apos;t have to do anything to save the deck.
                If it cannot save the change (i.e. network problem) it will immediatelly revert the
                change, the cards you see in the deck is what actually saved on the server. You can
                close the page anytime without losing progress.
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Immutable URL - create link to unchangeable copy of the deck. Good for forum/blog
                posts and where you want everybody to have same exact deck forever (your future
                changes in the deck will not change the deck by the link).
              </li>
              <li>
                Deck-in-URL - copy URL containing everything about the deck. Bulletproof, can be
                decoded even if VDB is dead. Good, but long.

                Draw probability in draw simulator available on Deck Draw button is calculated as
                chance to initially draw cards in existing hand (with respect to hand size and
                discarded cards). It is not the chance to draw additional cards to your hand, but
                chance to draw cards in the hand in the first place (imagine you return hand to the
                library, excluding already played cards, shuffle it and draw back to your hand size)

                Flexible. These decks can share cards between them, like you want for your temporary
                test decks or if your card pool is not big (yet)

                Fixed. These decks each use unique cards like for your permanent decks you dont want
                to disassembly between game sessions

              You can change status of the deck in Deck page by clicking Status button next to deck

              Additionally you can set status per-card (i.e. if your deck is fixed except few
              Masters you swap between decks) clicking on the icon to the left of the card in the
              deck list. All other cards of the deck will continue to be of the deck status

            This feature available at <Link to="/tda">TDA</Link> lets you browse decks of particular
            tournament using standard TWD search filters.
          </div>

          <div>
            To work it uses:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Decks in TWD-like text format. Hard requirement for all decks: author must be
                VEKN_ID (that is how VDB will link the deck with Archon to find scores/place). It
                does not require all decks from the tournament, it will load what is available (but
                sure more decks gives more info).
              </li>
              <li>
                Correct Archon. Do not be surprised your Archon may not work out of the box, but
                most likely it will be possible to fix.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            The approach is that you can either load Archon+Decks yourself, or use data of any
            pre-processed tournament (like Finnish Nationals 2022 already available, and more to
            come when organizers starts to adopt the practice of getting decklists from players).
          </div>

          <div>
            The only way to have Archon and Decks is to proactively COLLECT THEM. The initiative
            behind it is{' '}

            by Rune (Discord: rune3483). It requires efforts from organizers, so do not expect many
            tournaments to be available soon, but if you like the feature convince *and help* your
            organizer to gather that data.

          <div>
            If you want to organize the tournament, collect the decks and have them at TWDA EXTENDED
            let me or Rune know (contacts at the bottom of <Link to="/about">About page</Link>) and
            we will direct you.
