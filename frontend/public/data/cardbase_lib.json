During your master phase, you may choose a location controlled by another Methuselah. Until the end of your minion phase, any minion can move that location to its owner's library as a (D) action (the owner shuffles afterward). If that action is successful, that controller gains X pool, where X is the pool cost of the location. Any vampire can call a referendum to burn this card as a +1 stealth political action. You may lock this card to gain 1 vote in that referendum.","clan":"","conviction":"","discipline":"","id":102211,"name":"Zoning Board","pool":"1","requirement":"","rulings":[{"text":"The two actions provided are not cross-restrictive.
